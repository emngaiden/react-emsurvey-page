# Emnsurvey
## A super-commented React.js code-piece

I made this project for people who can't understand tutorials, but have the ease of understanding by reading comments and following the code flow.

### Contents:
- Eveything I've done as a hobby
- A semi-functional web-page
- Help, and possible error tips for when you create your own page
- Cringe-inducing comments.
- References to obscure things.
